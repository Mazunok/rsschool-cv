## About myself

  At 22 I have already tried to find myself in so many proffessions. I always was good at math., physics, computer science(school level), I always was intrested in numbers, and everything that connected with it. But despite all these facts I still tried to find myself in something different. I graduated from *The Linguistic College* in Minsk, I worked as a waiter, a manager (in a hotel, a salon, a sport center), a makeup artist, I even tried myself in tourism. But what I can tell you, I have never thought about becoming a programmer.

  After all these unsuccessful attempts, I'd heard about programming and decided to learn some more information about it. I started from the beggining, and realised that if I don't try, I'll lose something intresting in my life. So here I am. I'm ready to learn a lot of information, rise my skills, spend my time for something I'm really intrested in. 

  I want to become a Frontend Developer and I think that with my desire for knowledge and growing as a person I can do it.
