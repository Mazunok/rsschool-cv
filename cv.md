## About myself

  At 22 I have already tried to find myself in so many proffessions. I alwas was good at math., physics, computer science(school level), I always was intrested in numbers, and everything is connected with it. But despite all these facts I still tried to find myself in something different. I graduated *The Linguistic College* in Minsk, I worked as a waiter, manager (in hotel, salon, sport centter), makeup artist, I even tried myself in tourism. But what I can tell you, I have never thought about becoming a programer.

  After all these unsuccessful tries, I've heard about programming and decided to learn some more information about it. I've started from the beggining, and understood that if I won't try, I'll lose something intresting in my life. So here I am. I'm ready to learn a lot of informations, rise my skills, spend my time for something I'm really intrested in. 

  I want to become a Frontend Developer and I think that with my desire for knowledge and growing as a person I can do it.
